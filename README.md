# WHATSAPP CHAT ANALYSER

The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is a powerful tool designed to provide insightful analysis of WhatsApp conversations. By leveraging advanced data processing techniques, this application extracts and visualizes key metrics from chat logs, enabling users to gain a deeper understanding of their messaging patterns. Users can upload their WhatsApp chat exports, and the analyzer will generate comprehensive reports on various aspects such as the most active participants, peak chatting times, frequently used words, and emojis.
